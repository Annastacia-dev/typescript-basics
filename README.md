# Typescript-basics

This is a collection of TypeScript examples that I've created to help me learn the language. I'm using the examples to help me learn the language and to help me understand how to use TypeScript in my own projects.

## Installations

Assuming you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, you can install TypeScript using npm.

To install TypeScript, you can use npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

You should also install ts-node, which is a TypeScript execution and REPL for node.js, with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

 You can also use the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/) to try out TypeScript without installing anything on your computer.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Annastacia-dev/typescript-basics.git
cd typescript-basics
npm install
```
